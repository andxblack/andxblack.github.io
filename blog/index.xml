      <description>In Semester 1 this year, I will again be teaching an honours course which I have roughly titled: Advanced Stochastic Modelling and Monte Carlo methods. For those of you considering it, this post gives an outline of the topics I intend to cover this year. Due to the restrictions on in-person teaching and workload constraints, all honours courses will be run as reading courses. This means there will be no lectures and instead a single weekly workshop.</description>

      <description>Two pieces of work I have contributed to on the Australian response to COVID-19 have been published on the Doherty Institute website.
Update: The first piece of work on the scenario modelling has now been published in Emerging Infectious Diseases. The risk analysis work is still undergoing a rather lengthy review, but a preprint can be found on medRXiv.</description>
