      <description>In Semester 1 this year, I will again be teaching an honours course which I have roughly titled: Advanced Stochastic Modelling and Monte Carlo Methods. For those of you considering it, this post gives an outline of the topics I intend to cover this year. Due to the restrictions on in-person teaching and workload constraints, all honours courses will be run as reading courses this year. This means there will be no lectures and instead a single weekly workshop.</description>
