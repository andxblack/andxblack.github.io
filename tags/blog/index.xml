      <description>This post summarises my answer to a common question I get from mathematics students.
I&amp;rsquo;m not dogmatic about this; I recommend either R, Julia or Python depending on your project and specialisation. If youâ€™re doing statistics, R is a no-brainer. For machine-learning heavy work, Python is still the standard. For more general numerical computing and simulation, for example Monte Carlo and MCMC (most of what I research day to day) I recommend Julia now because these things need to be fast.</description>

      <description>I created the poster for the upcoming Applied Probability conference being held for Phil Pollett&amp;rsquo;s 60&amp;rsquo;th birthday. Inspired by some of Anders Hoff&amp;rsquo;s work, I tried to capture the layer structure of Uluru using a line tracing algorithm written in Processing, which uses Java behind the scenes. Roughly, it starts with a straight line and then tries to copy this, but with some noise added. After many iterations larger scale patterns start to emerge.</description>
